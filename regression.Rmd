# Analysis

In order to understand the likelihood of a drug related death occuring in the hospital versus not in the hospital, we binarized the variable `death_location` as the outcome (1 = In the hospital, 0 = Not in the hospital). For this logistic regression analysis we used a generlized logistic model with the predictors age, sex, race and county of residence. `Age` was treated as a continuous variable. `Sex` was categorical (Male, Female, and Unknown) with Male as the reference category based on frequency. `Race` was categorical with White, Black, Hispanic White, Asian, Other, Hispanic Black; White was the reference category based on frequency and NAs were dropped pre-analysis (n= 16). Finally the 8 `Counties` of CT were converted to factor variables with all other counties being converted to "out of state" with Litchfield Country as the reference variable based on frequency, NAs were dropped (n= 7).

The significant variables in the model (p-value < 0.05) were  age, Female, Hartford and New London Counties and the  "Out of State" category.
